                    Career
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working at Timely Comics, later to be named Marvel Comics, Stanley Martin Lieber actually got his start as an assistant, making sure the staff's needs were met, before he actually started writing comics. Some time later, however, he would commence his very first work, Captain America Comics #3, under the pen name of Stan Lee. He would adopt this as his real name years later.

                    In 1942, Stan Lee entered the army and was eventually signed to the Training Films Division. Lee's Division included many soon-to-be famous individuals, such as Frank Capra, Charles Addams, and Theodore Geisel. Lee's writing career was by no means interrupted by his time in the army. In fact, he continued to recieve letters from Timely, and would often send his work back to the syndicate.

                    Stan quickly became a figurehead for the Marvel Comics syndicate, and served for a brief time as president. However, he stepped down shortly thereafter, as the promotion tended to focus more on the numbers, and less on the creative aspect that he was so fond of.

                    He retired from Marvel in the 90's, but would go on to pursue several independent ventures before his death on November 12, 2018.
